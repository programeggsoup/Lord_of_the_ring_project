    Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of 
    Rohan. , He will need

She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.

The war has started."
GANDALF:,"The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.,
 "
GANDALF:,"Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman
to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge......for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
    ,The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Theoden
is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning......we have one advantage. ,
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it......has not yet entered
their darkest dreams. ,
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor......in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom. ,
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed......and the secrecy of his quest.,

Frodo must finish this task alone.,

cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This 
exile, crept from the shadows will never be crowned King. ,Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those who are closest to him� those he 
professes to love! Tell me, what words of comfort did you give the Halfling 
before you sent him to his doom? The path that you have set him on can only lead 
to death. ,

    , He knows the Heir of 
    Elendil has come forth , ,
    Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough, 
    perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples 
    of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. , He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground

    sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit

  Let him stay there!  Let him rot!  Why should we care?,

  No.  There is still hope for Frodo.  He needs time and safe passage across the plains of

and goodness knows what.
It's not natural. None of it.,
 "
FRODO:,"What's in this?,
 "
SAM:,"Nothing.Just a bit of seasoning.I thought maybe if we was having,
a roast chicken one night or something.,
 "
FRODO:,"Roast chicken?!,
 "
SAM:,"You never know.,
 "
FRODO:,"Sam. My dear Sam.,
 "

It's the best salt in all the Shire.,

FRODO:,"We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.,
 "
SAM:,"Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.,
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.,
    Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.Won't come free in a hurry.,

FRODO:,"Real Elvish rope.,

SAM:,"Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
,
    Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.,

FRODO:,"He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam......but they did.,

It's the Ring, isn't it?,

SAM:,"Let me see.Oh, yes. Lovely.
Lembas bread. And look!
More lembas bread.,

FRODO:,"Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?,
 "
SAM:,"Those rain clouds might.,
 "
SAM:,"This looks strangely familiar.,
 "
FRODO:,"It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.,
 "
SAM:,"What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?,

FRODO:,"Yes.....I can smell it.................We're not alone.,

GOLLUM:,"The thieves............... The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?.............

GOLLUM:,"It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.,

That would kill us! Kill us!,

You will lead us to the Black Gate.,

Not there. Not to him.

GANDALF:,"Yes the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King. Lord Denethor 
    however, is not the King. He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.,
 "
GANDALF:,"Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir�s father. To give him 
    news of his beloved son�s death would be most unwise. And do not mention 
    Frodo or the Ring. And say nothing of Aragorn either. In fact, its better if 
    you don�t speak at all Peregrin Took. ,
 "
GANDALF:,"Hail Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor.,
 "
GANDALF:,"I come with tidings in this dark hour and with counsel.,
 "
DENETHOR:,"Perhaps you come to explain this. ,
 "
DENETHOR: ,"Perhaps you have come to tell me why my son is dead.,
 "
PIPPIN:,"Boromir died to save us my kinsman and me. He fell defending us from 
    many foes. "
GANDALF: ,"Pippin.,
 "
PIPPIN:,"I offer you my service, such as it is in payment of this debt. ,
 "
DENETHOR:,"This is my first command to you. How did you escape and my son did not? 
    So mighty as man as he was.,
 "
PIPPIN: ,"The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow and Boromir was pierced by 
    many.,
 "
GANDALF: ,"Get up!,
 "
GANDALF:,"My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir but it is not now. 
    War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged 
    with the defence of this city. Where are Gondor�s armies? You still have 
    friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Theoden of Rohan. 
    Light the beacons.,
 "
DENETHOR:,"You think you are wise Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have 
    not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen 
    more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against 
    Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides 
    with Theoden of Rohan. Oh yes, word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son 
    of Arathorn. And I tell you now. I will not bow to this Ranger from the 
    North. Last of a ragged house long bereft of Lordship. ,
 "
GANDALF:,"Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King, steward.,
 "
DENETHOR:,"The rule of Gondor is mine and no others!,
 "
GANDALF:,"Come!,
 "
GANDALF:,"All had turned to vain ambition. He would use even his grief as a cloak! 
    A thousand years this city has stood and now at the whim of a madman it will 
    fall! And the white tree, the tree of the King will never bloom again.,
 "
PIPPIN:,"Why are they still guarding it? ,
 "
GANDALF: ,"They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one 
    day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once 
    was before it fell into decay. , ,
    The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more 
    splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their 
    descent , dearer than the names of their sons.
    , ,
    Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers 
    asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.
    , ,
    The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was 
    given over to lesser men."
PIPPIN:,"Mordor.,
 "
GANDALF:,"Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.,
 "
PIPPIN: ,"A storm is coming.,
 "
GANDALF:,"This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron�s 
    making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have 
    no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage 
    along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will 
    begin.,
 "
PIPPIN: ,"Well� Minas Tirith� very impressive. ,So where are off to next?,
 "
GANDALF: ,"Oh, it�s too late for that Peregrin. There�s no leaving this city.
    , ,
    Help must come to us."
